# Automated Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
This is a simple automated tic-tac-toe game, where the moves are played at random by AI, and the first player is randomly chosen. This will run until a player has won 10 rounds. At the end of each winning game, the board is printed to the page and the console, with subsequent data about how long it took for the simulation to run.
